"""
A small but well-structured Panda3D adventure game.

Run with:
    python -m aiden.adventure.main

Requirements:
    pip install panda3d

Tip: The game uses Panda3D sample models like "models/environment" and
misc models such as "models/misc/rgbCube" and "models/misc/smiley" which
are included with Panda3D. If your installation misses them, the code falls
back to simple generated geometry.
